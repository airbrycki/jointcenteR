Description: Makes routine tasks easier, from loading data to running tabs and 
  exporting them to excel. Loads American Community Survey datasets into global 
  environment. Splits multiyear ACS file into manageable dataframes. Applies ACS 
  and JCHS variable labels. Processes common public datasets, like New Residential 
  Construction, Housing Vacancy Survey, and HUD AHAR. Calculates weighted and 
  unweighted estimates with counts and shares or medians for large survey datasets. 
  Inflates continuous variables to target year dollars using CPI-U All Items, and 
  inflates rents to target year dollars using CPI-U Less Shelter. Exports tabs to 
  an excel workbook. Splits text document into spreadsheet rows for facthchecking.
